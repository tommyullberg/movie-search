## Background

Never had anything on my own GitHub until I started applying for jobs this summer, so I thought I'd better put something there, just to show I exist, since some job descriptions says they wish to see a portfolio, if possible.

I would like to have time to make some kind of portfolio. But I can't put our clients' sites here, so maybe I put some images or some modules extracted to a stand-alone simple site. I'll see what I have time for.

## About

I start by refreshing my React knowledge a bit and just put it on GH-pages.

Fetching movies and details from the API at [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
