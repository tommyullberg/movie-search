## About

Never had my own GitHub until I started applying for jobs this summer, so I thought I'd better start an account and put something there, just to show I exist.
I would like to have time to make some kind of portfolio. But I can't put our clients' sites here, so maybe some images or some modules extracted to a stand-alone simple site. I'll see what I have time for. 

But for now I start by refreshing my React knowledge a bit and just put it on GH-pages.

Fetching movies and details from the API at [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
